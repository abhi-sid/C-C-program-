Attached is the most complex code that I have written still in C++. The code is a Menu Driven Banking Appliation that deals with login, Account opening, Transactions, Closing an existing account and logout from the application. The header files that are used are attached in a separate word file. I had a lot of fun creating the application as it has most of menu driven and OOP functionalities and a lot of pre defined methods that are used in C, I got to learn a lot from this project.

Also attached is a Hangman Word guessing game code, it does not exceed 200 lines, but it was a fun game that I built in a day.
